# TypeScript Interface Proposals

This project provides a curated collection of interface proposals for commonly used functionalities within the TypeScript ecosystem. Our goal is to standardize these interfaces to improve code reusability, interoperability, and the overall developer experience. By offering well-defined, community-vetted interfaces, we aim to reduce boilerplate and promote best practices.

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

Developers often face challenges such as:

- **Library Lock-in & Abstraction Overhead**: Spending significant time choosing between numerous libraries for similar tasks and then writing custom abstractions over them.
- **Inconsistent Codebases**: Different projects using varied abstractions for identical functionalities, increasing the learning curve for developers switching contexts.
- **Tooling Difficulties**: Inconsistent or non-standard interfaces make it harder for tools, including AI-powered assistants like LLMs, to understand and effectively work with codebases.

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

Adopting these proposed interfaces offers several advantages:

- **Simplified Development**: Pick up a ready-to-use interface and integrate it quickly, bypassing the usual complexities of library selection and custom abstraction design.
- **LLM-Friendly**: Standardized interfaces are easier for Large Language Models to understand and leverage, leading to more accurate code generation, better analysis, and more helpful assistance.
- **Enhanced Abstraction & Flexibility**: Decouple your core application logic from specific third-party library implementations. This makes it easier to swap out underlying dependencies or adapt to new technologies without major refactoring.
- **Improved Consistency & Collaboration**: Foster a common understanding and approach to typical tasks across different projects and teams, reducing onboarding time and improving code maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Proposals

You can leverage these proposals in several ways:

- **Install as a Package (Future Goal)**: We aim to publish these interfaces as an npm package (e.g., `@tsip/types`). Stay tuned for updates!
- **Copy-Paste**: For now, you can directly copy the interface definitions from the respective proposal files/sections into your project.
- **Reference & Inspiration**: Use these proposals as a solid foundation or inspiration when designing new libraries or discussing interface standardization within your teams or the broader community.
- **Contribute**: Your feedback and contributions are highly valued! Review existing proposals, suggest improvements, or propose new interfaces.

## üöÄ Available Proposals

- [TSIP-01: `BaseError` Interface](./proposals/TSIP-01%20BaseError.md) - A standardized Error class with additional properties.
- [TSIP-02: `ErrorLogger` Interface](./proposals/TSIP-02%20ErrorLogger.md) - A standardized interface for error logging.
- _(More to come...)_
